# EVModel
The EVModel is an agent based EV charging simulation model. It allows to generate charging, availability,
and flexibility profiles for large numbers of EVs for several weeks, and considering different charging strategies.

It includes a non-systematic plug-in behavior model. If you use it, please reference the associated paper: Gonzalez Venegas, F., Petit, M., Perez, Y., "Plug-in behavior of electric vehicles users: insights from alarge-scale trial and impacts for grid integration studies" 2021, eTransportation.

A script to generate EV charging profiles is provided.
